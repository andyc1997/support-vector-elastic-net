### Support Vector Elastic Net
Support vector elastic net (SVEN) is a method which formulates elastic net regression problem as a support vector machine (SVM) binary classification problem.

I started this project from scratch as a demo based on the following research papers.
1. A Reduction of the Elastic Net to Support Vector Machines with an Application to GPU Computing (Zhou, Chen & Song, 2015)
2. Training a Support Vector Machine in the Primal (Chapelle, 2006)
